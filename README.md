# YouTube Video Transcript Analyzer 

Welcome to the **yt_api_video_intel_data_science_vizs** repository. This repository contains a Python-based data science project that leverages the YouTube Data API and the YouTube Transcript API for extracting, analyzing, and visualizing YouTube video transcript data. 

## Description

The main purpose of this project is to derive insights from YouTube video transcripts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The project contains several key features:

1. **Caption Extraction**: Retrieves both automatic and manual captions of a YouTube video.
2. **Transcript Extraction**: Generates the transcript of a YouTube video.
3. **Transcript Preprocessing**: Performs text cleaning and preprocessing on the transcripts.
4. **Data Analysis**: Conducts various types of analyses such as word frequency analysis, topic distribution, sentiment analysis, speaker contribution analysis, and named entity recognition.
5. **Data Visualization**: Creates informative visualizations to better understand the derived insights.
6. **Topic Modeling**: Implements Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for classifying text in a document to a specific topic.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies for this project, run the following command:

```bash
pip install youtube_transcript_api requests json nltk spacy gensim pyLDAvis plotly
```
## Usage

To use this project, upload the Jupyter notebook to your Jupyter Notebook environment or any IDE that supports .ipynb files. Ensure you have a valid YouTube Data API key for extracting video captions.
